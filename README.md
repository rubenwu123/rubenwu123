- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rubenwu123
- I am currently learning how to use Python to create and work on hands on projects. I am currently learning how to use Pandas and Numpy
for data vizualization. More updates on projects to come. 
- Portfolio: As of right now, I have been able to write code for a  Alien Invasion game (shoutout to the book Python Crash Course) which
I will be displaying in a repository.
